	  This is a continuation of Mark Pilgrim's excellent chardet.
	  Previously, two versions needed to be maintained: one that
	  supported python 2.x and one that supported python 3.x. We've
	  recently merged with Ian Cordasco's charade fork, so now we
	  have one coherent version that works for Python 2.6+.
